/*
good point materials
nice functions/space










/* check list
look:
color,//done
size,//done
shape,//eh...
transparency,
change with distance, 


trails, - use curves
links, - use lines of lines of lines????
function,
behavior



metrics,
surfaces and volumes,
projections, functions, 
domains, codomains


symetry
rotation 
mirror,
fractal


set theory


consider dimensions:
2 to 2
3 to 2


1 to 3 space filling  
1 to 2 space filling
2 to 3 surface       - needs 2d grid sure a line of lines

3 to 3               - 3d grid? sure a line of lines of lines
3 to 1 projection
3 to 2 projection



construct then function to the rest
set of points in 2d -> set of points in 3d -> set of points in 3d

base set, some maps, point material
