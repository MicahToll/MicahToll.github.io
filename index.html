                <h2>Four Dimensional Shape Viewer</h2>
                <p>This was my senior project in High School.  What it does is allow the user to view one of a selections of 4D shapes as a 2D or 3D projection.  Of course, till someone invents the holodeck, you'll have to use red/blue 3D glasses for the 3D projection.  lastly, the controls were set up for use with a controller, so until I decide to go back and change it, the controls will be rather unwieldy.</p>

                <h2>SPACE!!!</h2>
                <p>This is the project I'm working on currently.  It's just a basic spaceship simulator that I'm making primarily to learn to use THREE.js</p>
