                    <h2>Reletivity Race</h2>
                    <p>I began on Reletivity Race when I started to learn THREE.js. In it, you fly a space ship and are subject to the effects of special relativity. It is currently unfinished.</p>

                    <h2>Kirby Shoot 'em up Fan Game</h2>
                    <p>I really enjoy Kirby games, and I thought kirby would make for a good bullet hell game. This is my attempt at such a game. It is currently unfinished and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future</p>

                    <h2>Four Dimensional Shape Viewer</h2>
                    <p>This was my senior project in High School. The goal was to display 2D projections of a selection of 4D shapes. Specifically, I was curious if anaglyph 3D glasses might make the projections easier for the user to understand (ultimately, it didn't help much, but it was cool anyway).</p>

                    <h2>Chord Diagram</h2>
                    <p>For my senior thesis at OSU, I made a plot showing the correlations between student answer correctness for questions in an introductory physics course. This plot used the D3 library to construct the svg.</p>

                    <p>I was the game master for a fanatasy RPG and drew up some characters tokens who I thought turned out petty nice. </p>
                    <p>I have them posted here: <a href="rpgTokens/rpgTokens.html">RPG Character Tokens</a></p>
