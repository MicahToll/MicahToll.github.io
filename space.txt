some notes on space game:
premise - near earth and our solar system and galaxy physics and space is constant, but out there, past our solar system, the world is far more complecated.

Sci-fi, tech, and ship elements
Hyperspace/light speed/wormholes?  For long distance travel, what will I use?
	Light speed would be bad, because that is the same as instant teleportation, so no light speed.  
	"going really fast" aka relitivistic speeds, is fine, but has two problems: 
		(a)  I'd have to deal with time dialation - eh... That might be fun and worth it (or it may not matter for the scope of this game.  
		(b)  It uses a LOT of energy, plus it is dificult to distinguish from normal travel.  also, would I need to make sparate graphical effects?  not sure, that might be a feature.
	wormholes/UMN column:
		advantage: can't do it anywhere and would allow me to curve space (yay?)
		disadvantage, might be a bit wierd and wouldn't feel as "connected"
force shields should be separate from armor, not sure how they work yet.
armor, resists dmg, not sure how helpful it is though.  
lasers, deal dmg.  not as effective against let
explosive missiles are also effective


universe elements - 
near earth, and the solar system there are more normal more space, less weird stuff.  Additionally, near by things are not procedurally generated.
further away, things are procedurally generated and bizzar.  
I may have the UMN columns from xenosaga, but that's about it.


how will draw distance work?  
if I use a combination of fractals and draw distance I should get a good result
	ex.  a nearby star is more detailed than a far star


controls
	wasd for direction, a slider on dash for speed.

Will uses Meaba system for characters if needed <not needed>
